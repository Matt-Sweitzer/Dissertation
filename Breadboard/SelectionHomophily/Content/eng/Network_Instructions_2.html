<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 16px; font-family: Serif;">On the left-hand side of your screen, you can see a graphical representation of your social network. The large circle in the center of the graph labeled <strong>{0}</strong> is you and the smaller circles with different labels represent other participants in the study (i.e., your social contacts). If a line connects your circle with another, that means you have a <em>tie</em> with that person. Your decisions and the decisions of other participants about you will affect these ties. If a tie is broken, the other participant will be removed from this graph and from your social network. If a new tie is formed, that means the other person has been added to your social network.</p>
